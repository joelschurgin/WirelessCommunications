# Wireless Communications
Python implementation of TX and RX using M-QAM encoding and decoding, pulse shaping, matched filtering, symbol timing recovery, sample alignment, frame-sync, and channel correction.

Plots are included to show M-QAM encoding, bit error rates for different values of M, and IQ constellations of the signals captured on hardware.

Runs on the [ADALM Pluto](www.analog.com/en/resources/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/adalm-pluto.html)
